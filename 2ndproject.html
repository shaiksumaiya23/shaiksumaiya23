    <h1>A Little History of the World Wide Web</h1>
    <p><em>See also <a href=".com">How It All Started </a> presentation materials from the <a href=".com">W3C 10th Anniversary Celebration</a>
          and <a href=".com">other references</a></em></p>
        <p>from 1945 to 1995</p>
        <p><strong>1945</strong></p>
        <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href=".com">an article</a> in <a href=".com">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for memory extension, which could make and follow 
            links between documents on microfiche</p>
        <p><strong>1960s</strong></p>
        <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on. He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href=".com">Bootstrap Institute library.</a><br> <br>

             
                Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in <em>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.</em> 20th National Conference, New York,<a href=".com">Association for Computing Machinery</a>,<br> 1965. See also: 
                Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: 
                A Selected Bibliography" by Terence Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link. <br><br>
            
            Andy van Dam and others build the Hypertext Editing System and FRESS in 1967.</p>
        <p><strong>1970</strong></p>
        <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes 
            a notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under SINTRAN-III. See: <a href=".com">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a>
           or as <a href=".com">HTML page(alt)</a>.</p>

            <dd>Mike Sendall, Tim's boss, Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system.</dd>
            <dt>October</dt>
            <dd>Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment. He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See the <a href=".com">first browser</a> screenshot) "World Wide Web" as a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine). <br>
            Project <a href=".com">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert <a href=".com">Cailliau</a> (ECP) joins and is co-author of <a href=".com">new version</a>. </dd>
            <dd>Initial WorldWideWeb program development continues on the NeXT (TBL) . This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with direct inline creation of links. The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the <strong>first web page</strong> http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the least recently modified web page we know of, last changed Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.)</dd>
            <dt>November</dt>
            <dd>Technical Student Nicola <a href=".com">Pellow</a> (CN) joins and starts work on the line-mode browser. Bernd <a href=".com">Pollermann</a> (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM "FIND" index running. TBL gives a colloquium on hypertext in general.</dd>
            <dt>Christmas</dt>
            <dd>Line mode browser and <a href=".com">WorldWideWeb</a> browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.</dd>
